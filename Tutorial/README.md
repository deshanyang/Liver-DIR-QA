# Dataset Tutorial
To help researchers to get started with the dataset, we included this tutorial to help with loading data into and using MatchGui. For more specific questions, please message us or email at deshan.yang@duke.edu.

## Matchgui installation
The source code for MatchGui is located in the matchgui folder of this Github repository. Download the folder to a desired location, unzip and add it to the Matlab path either by using the command addpath(foldername) or by going to Home->Set Path-> Add Folder. MatchGui should be compatible with Matlab R2022a, provided other dependencies are met. It is currently not stable on Matlab2019a or Matlab2017a.
